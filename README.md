# JSON Configurable Subsystems
Configure WPILib subsystems using JSON files rather than the typically `Constants.java` approach. This is a more standard, modern practice which keeps configuration options well-scoped and allows for simpler configuration. 

## This project 
This project is a command-based program skeleton. To see an example of the usage of the JSON configuration, simply download and run this project. The file which new is `JsonConfigurableSubsystems.java` 

## Usage
Simply copy the source from `JsonConfigurableSubsystems.java` and include it in your project. Extend subsystems you would like to configure with JSON from the `JsonConfigurableSubsystems` class rather than `SubsystemBase`. Place any configurations in `deploy/config/name-of-your-subsystem.json`. Call the `getConfig()` method to access your properties.
